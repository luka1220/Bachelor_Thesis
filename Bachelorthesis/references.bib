	abstract = {Interactive machine learning (IML) is a learning process in which a user interacts with a system to iteratively define and optimise a model. Although recent years have illustrated the proliferation of IML systems in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Systems (IS), and Computer Science (CS), current research results are scattered leading to a lack of integration of existing work on IML. Furthermore, due to diverging functionalities and purposes IML systems can refer to, an uncertainty exists regarding the underlying distinct capabilities that constitute this class of systems. By reviewing extensive IML literature, this paper suggests an integrative theoretical framework for IML systems to address these current impediments. Reviewing 2,879 studies in leading journals and conferences during the years 1966-2018, we found an extensive range of applications areas that have implemented IML systems and the necessity to standardise the evaluation of those systems. Our framework offers an essential step to provide a theoretical foundation to integrate concepts and findings across different fields of research. The main contribution of this paper is organising and structuring the body of knowledge in IML for the advancement of the field. Furthermore, we suggest three opportunities for future IML research. From a practical point of view, our integrative theoretical framework can serve as a reference guide to inform the design and implementation of IML systems.},

	abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence, sensors and big data management have far-reaching societal impacts. As these systems augment our everyday lives, it becomes increasingly important for people to understand them and remain in control. We investigate how HCI researchers can help to develop accountable systems by performing a literature analysis of 289 core papers on explanations and explainable systems, as well as 12,412 citing papers. Using topic modeling, co-occurrence and network analysis, we mapped the research space from diverse domains, such as algorithmic accountability, interpretable machine learning, context-awareness, cognitive psychology, and software learnability. We reveal fading and burgeoning trends in explainable systems, and identify domains that are closely connected or mostly isolated. The time is ripe for the HCI community to ensure that the powerful new autonomous systems have intelligible interfaces built-in. From our results, we propose several implications and directions for future research towards this goal.},

Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to “travel” to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover’s Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efﬁcient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classiﬁcation data sets, in comparison with seven stateof-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classiﬁcation error rates.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. It involves the statistical inference of models (such as classiﬁers) from data. It is often conceived in a very impersonal way, with algorithms working autonomously on passively collected data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, and even deciding what should be modeled in the ﬁrst place. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognising this human work, as well as reframing machine learning workﬂows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the coadaptation of humans and systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human context can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of framing learning computationally. This workshop will bring together researchers to discuss these issues and suggest future research questions aimed at creating a human-centered approach to machine learning.},

However, in practice, they may have thousands of cycles, as they are often created in a crowd-sourced way. Since these cycles represent logical fallacies, they need to be removed for many web applications. In this paper, we address the problem of breaking cycles while preserving the logical structure (hierarchy) of a directed graph as much as possible. Existing approaches for this problem either need manual intervention or use heuristics that can critically alter the taxonomy structure. In contrast, our approach infers graph hierarchy using a range of features, including a Bayesian skill rating system and a social agony metric. We also devise several strategies to leverage the inferred hierarchy for removing a small subset of edges to make the graph acyclic. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Within the context of new product development processes and the Creative Problem Solving (CPS) process, the authors have come to the view that clustering is to be seen as a separate step in the process of diverging and converging. Clustering is generally presented as part of the converging stages, and as such categorized as a selection technique, which in the authors' view does not do justice to this activity. It is about expanding knowledge, about connecting ideas, and connecting ideas to problem statements, functionalities, and values and consequences. It is about building a shared understanding, in other words about ‘making sense’, an essential creative activity in the development of concepts and, although different from a more freewheeling divergent phase, can be as creative and maybe even more so. Four kinds of clusterings are distinguished: object clustering, morphological clustering, functional clustering and gestalt clustering. Object clustering is mainly aimed at categorizing ideas into an overviewable set of groups of ideas. No special connections are being made, other then looking for similarities. Morphological clustering is used to split up a problem into subproblems after which the ideas generated are considered as subsolutions which can then be combined into concepts. Functional clustering is interesting when different approaches can be chosen to answer some question. It permits a more strategic choice to be made. Gestalt clustering is a more synthesis like approach, often with a more metaphoric and artistic stance. Collage is a good example of such clustering. General guidelines for clustering are: use a bottom-up process of emergence; postpone early rationalisations and verbalisations; start grouping ideas on the basis of feeling and intuition; and use metaphoric names to identify clusters.},

Assessing relatedness of knowledge graph entities is crucial for several data-driven tasks, e.g., ranking, clustering, or link discovery. However, existing similarity measures consider aspects in isolation when determining entity relatedness. We address the problem of similarity assessment between knowledge graph entities, and devise GADES. GADES relies on aspect similarities and computes a similarity measure as the combination of these similarity values. We empirically evaluate the accuracy of GADES on knowledge graphs from diﬀerent domains, e.g., proteins, and news. Experiment results indicate that GADES exhibits higher correlation with gold standards than studied existing approaches. Thus, these results suggest that similarity measures should not consider aspects in isolation, but combinations of them to precisely determine relatedness.},

	url = {https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/40046559},
	abstract = {Online collective ideation platforms, such as OpenIDEO or Quirky, have demonstrated the potential of large-scale collective innovation in various domains. However, the users of these platforms face new challenges of leveraging collective contributions. The large number of collected ideas prevents users from making full use of these ideas. Finding inspirations from the ideas involves wading through a sea of possibly mundane and redundant ideas. Synthesizing a few solutions from these ideas takes a lot of time and effort. I argue that leaving users to explore ideas in a haphazard manner is ineffective and can decrease the quality of people's creative output. Prior work in cognitive science and creativity research has also suggested that deliberate exploration of the solution space can improve users' creative output and experience. 
I introduce the concept of an idea map, a computational model of the emerging solution space that enables deliberate exploration interactions: 1) presenting a set of ideas with a controlled level of diversity appropriate to the stage of the creative process and 2) presenting a summary view of the solution space. I describe two scalable crowdsourced methods for generating this computational model. The first method computes the model from responses from small micro-task questions. The second method takes an "integrated crowdsourcing" approach that computes the model from users' natural activities during idea generation. The evaluation of the derived models show that the idea maps from both approaches agree with human judgments of similarities among ideas. I show the application of the idea map concept through experiments and a system called IdeaHound. IdeaHound derives an idea map using the integrated crowdsourcing approach and uses the derived model to guide users' exploration of the solution space. The results of the experiments show that an idea map can inspire people to generate diverse ideas. The integrated activities that enable IdeaHound to collect similarity judgments do not deter users from generating ideas and provide enough information to generate a reliable idea map. I also present a study on the effects of different timings of delivering example ideas on an individual's idea generation. The results demonstrate that an intelligent system can provide inspiration at the right moment by using a computational model that is aware of semantic relationships between ideas. Finally, I demonstrate how to use an idea map to support sensemaking during the solution synthesis and present an empirical study of the effect of presenting a summary view of ideas on people's solution synthesis.},

	abstract = {Prior work on creativity support tools demonstrates how a computational semantic model of a solution space can enable interventions that substantially improve the number, quality and diversity of ideas. However, automated semantic modeling often falls short when people contribute short text snippets or sketches. Innovation platforms can employ humans to provide semantic judgments to construct a semantic model, but this relies on external workers completing a large number of tedious micro tasks. This requirement threatens both accuracy (external workers may lack expertise and context to make accurate semantic judgments) and scalability (external workers are costly). In this paper, we introduce IDEAHOUND, an ideation system that seamlessly integrates the task of deﬁning semantic relationships among ideas into the primary task of idea generation. The system combines implicit human actions with machine learning to create a computational semantic model of the emerging solution space. The integrated nature of these judgments allows IDEAHOUND to leverage the expertise and efforts of participants who are already motivated to contribute to idea generation, overcoming the issues of scalability inherent to existing approaches. Our results show that participants were equally willing to use (and just as productive using) IDEAHOUND compared to a conventional platform that did not require organizing ideas. Our integrated crowdsourcing approach also creates a more accurate semantic model than an existing crowdsourced approach (performed by external crowds). We demonstrate how this model enables helpful creative interventions: providing diverse inspirational examples, providing similar ideas for a given idea and providing a visual overview of the solution space.},

Previous work on semantic similarity methods have focused on either the structure of the semantic network between concepts (e.g., path length and depth), or only on the Information Content (IC) of concepts. We propose a semantic similarity method, namely wpath, to combine these two approaches, using IC to weight the shortest path length between concepts. Conventional corpus-based IC is computed from the distributions of concepts over textual corpus, which is required to prepare a domain corpus containing annotated concepts and has high computational cost. As instances are already extracted from textual corpus and annotated by concepts in KGs, graph-based IC is proposed to compute IC based on the distributions of concepts over instances. Through experiments performed on well known word similarity datasets, we show that the wpath semantic similarity method has produced a statistically significant improvement over other semantic similarity methods. Moreover, in a real category classification evaluation, the wpath method has shown the best performance in terms of accuracy and F score.},

This simple method even outperforms far more complex approaches such as LSTMs on textual similarity tasks. In this paper, we ﬁrst show that word vector length has a confounding effect on the probability of a sentence being generated in Arora et al.’s model. We propose a random walk model that is robust to this confound, where the probability of word generation is inversely related to the angular distance between the word and sentence embeddings. Our approach beats Arora et al.’s by up to 44.4\% on textual similarity tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. Unlike Arora et al.’s method, ours requires no hyperparameter tuning, which means it can be used when there is no labelled data.},

In this paper, we present RDF2Vec, an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words, and adapts them to RDF graphs. We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph sub-structures, harvested by Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels and graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. We evaluate our approach on three different tasks: (i) standard machine-learning tasks (ii) entity and document modeling (iii) content-based recommender systems. The evaluation shows that the proposed entity embeddings outperform existing techniques, and that feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks.},

To "understand" the query we expand it using encyclopedic knowledge in Wikipedia. The expanded query is linked with its associated documents through spreading activation in a graph that represents words and their grammatical connections in these documents. The topic expanded words and activated nodes in the graph are used to produce an extractive summary. The method proposed is tested on the DUC summarization data. The system implemented ranks high compared to the participating systems in the DUC competitions, confirming our hypothesis that encyclopedic knowledge is a useful addition to a summarization system.},

Entity names and Wikipedia anchors are utilized to align the embeddings of entities and words in the same space. Large scale experiments on Freebase and a Wikipedia/NY Times corpus show that jointly embedding brings promising improvement in the accuracy of predicting facts, compared to separately embedding knowledge graphs and text. Particularly, jointly embedding enables the prediction of facts containing entities out of the knowledge graph, which cannot be handled by previous embedding methods. At the same time, concerning the quality of the word embeddings, experiments on the analogical reasoning task show that jointly embedding is comparable to or slightly better than word2vec (Skip-Gram).},

	abstract = {Clustering of short texts, such as snippets, presents great challenges in existing aggregated search techniques due to the problem of data sparseness and the complex semantics of natural language. As short texts do not provide suﬃcient term co-occurrence information, traditional text representation methods, such as “bag of words” model, have several limitations when directly applied to short text tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve the performance of short text clustering by exploiting the internal semantics from the original text and external concepts from world knowledge. The proposed method employs a hierarchical three-level structure to tackle the data sparsity problem of original short texts and reconstruct the corresponding feature space with the integration of multiple semantic knowledge bases – Wikipedia and WordNet. Empirical evaluation with Reuters and real web dataset demonstrates that our approach is able to achieve signiﬁcant improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Subscribers to the popular news or blog feeds (RSS/Atom) often face the problem of information overload as these feed sources usually deliver large number of items periodically. One solution to this problem could be clustering similar items in the feed reader to make the information more manageable for a user. Clustering items at the feed reader end is a challenging task as usually only a small part of the actual article is received through the feed. In this paper, we propose a method of improving the accuracy of clustering short texts by enriching their representation with additional features from Wikipedia. Empirical results indicate that this enriched representation of text items can substantially improve the clustering accuracy when compared to the conventional bag of words representation.},

	abstract = {Topic models have great potential for helping users understand document corpora. This potential is stymied by their purely unsupervised nature, which often leads to topics that are neither entirely meaningful nor effective in extrinsic tasks (Chang et al., 2009). We propose a simple and effective way to guide topic models to learn topics of speciﬁc interest to a user. We achieve this by providing sets of seed words that a user believes are representative of the underlying topics in a corpus. Our model uses these seeds to improve both topicword distributions (by biasing topics to produce appropriate seed words) and to improve document-topic distributions (by biasing documents to select topics related to the seed words they contain). Extrinsic evaluation on a document clustering task reveals a signiﬁcant improvement when using seed information, even over other models that use seed information na¨ıvely.},

They contain general knowledge which can be used, e.g., for improving data analytics tools, text processing pipelines, or recommender systems. While the large players, e.g., DBpedia, YAGO, or Wikidata, are often considered similar in nature and coverage, there are, in fact, quite a few diﬀerences. In this paper, we quantify those diﬀerences, and identify the overlapping and the complementary parts of public KGs. From those considerations, we can conclude that the KGs are hardly interchangeable, and that each of them has its strenghts and weaknesses when it comes to applications in diﬀerent domains.},
